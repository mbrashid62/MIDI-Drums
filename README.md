# MIDI-Drums
This is an arduino project that listents to 4 different piezo sensor signals and trasmits corresponding bytes via USB. 
To use this code, you should have a way to trigger each of the four pins, a MIDI bridge setup on your computer, and a program that output MIDI sounds open (garageband works fine).
